                Simple Toolkit is a collection of fast, lightweight, and free online tools designed to help you with
                everyday tasks. No registrations, no complex interfaces—just the tools you need in one place.

            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>
                For years, I found myself bookmarking a multitude of different websites for simple tasks like
                calculating an age,
                generating a QR code, or converting units. Every site was different, and some were slow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually got tired of searching through my bookmarks or Googling the same tools over and over.
                I built Simple Toolkit to solve my own problem: having all the essential tools I need in a single,
                clean, and fast application.
